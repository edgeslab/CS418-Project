    "Our team is analyzing the correlation between the increasing economic polarization in Chicago and changing crime landscape of the city. We are finding out the factors contributing to the disappearing middle class. In order to go over factors, we are looking into the socioeconomic trends that could help us understand each community area in Chicago.\n",

    "\n",
    "For data cleaning, we used python to filter crimes data. We needed to use python because crime data csv file was too large. The Data we had initially consisted of crime data from the year 2001 to present. For this project, we only require data from 2008 to 2012 as we have to correalate it with the Socioeconomic data set which was from 2008 to 2012. We basically first cleaned the data by removing all the unwanted years. Furthermore, the crime data consisted alot of unneccessary columns. We decided to keep only the columns that were beneficial to our project and removed the rest so the file size could be reduced. The code for cleaning the data in our github directory. Lastly, the Socioeconomic data set is pretty small and it didn't need much cleaning. "

    "## Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If there is a low highschool graduation rate and a high unemployment rate in a community, then it will have more crime rate in that particular community.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you look at community area 25 in unemployment graph below. It's unemployment rate is roughly around 23.5% which is higher than many other community areas in the years between 2008 to 2012. Then if you look at the crime  graph below it can be seen that community 25 had the highest crime count with around 34,000 crimes during those 4 years as well. From the highschool dropout graph, it can be seen that community 25 also had a very high drop out rate at around 25% as well(much higher than other communites). All this contributed to high crime count in those four years for community 25. Many other communities follow such pattern. There are a few anomalies in the data but majority follow this pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "This was interesting to see because one can see the chain effect of school drop outs with unemployment rates and the negative effects of highschool dropouts with a huge increase in crime in those 4 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The middle class communities are getting poorer and poorer and are basically disappearing in to lower class. According to PEW Research, Middle class is considered to be between 42,000 to 135,000 dollars per capita income.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look closely at the capita per income, majority of the communities are below $42,000, classifying them in to the lower class. From that we can clearly see that middle class barely even exists. More than 80% of the communites are in this trap and Also the crimes rates and unemployment rates are also very high in these areas as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is interesting because our group considers ourselves middle class and comparing this data set shows us where we actually stand and shows us our actual reality. We need to figure out why it is actually happening with us and how we can fix this as we are being directly affected by this. The graph is going down every year and it is not looking good. \n",

Thus, we believe that per capita income has major effects on crime rate in chicago. This is a very imporatant insight in this project. Another insight, we have understood is that not having a highschool diploma also has impacts on crime counts. After closely analyzing the \"Highschool Education in Each Community\" visualization and comparing it against \"Crime count per Chicago Community Area\" visualization, we analyzed that communities with higher high school dropouts have higher crime counts. Its a direct relationship.This was another very interesting insight. \n",
